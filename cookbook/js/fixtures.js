Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the carrot, onion, celery and pancetta and cook, stirring, until vegetables are lightly golden brown, about 5 minutes.\\r\\n2. Add the ground beef, ground pork and prosciutto and cook until beef is no loner pink.\\r\\n3. Stir in the tomato paste, broth, and wine and bring to a simmer. Partially cover the pan, and cook the sauce at a low simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt, pepper and nutmeg. (The sauce may be made up to 2 days ehad; cover and refrigerate it, and bring the sauce to room temperature before assembling the lasagne.)\\r\\nFOR PASTA:\\r\\n1. Rinse spinach leaves in several changes of cold water; do not dry. Put leaves in a medium saucepan with pinch salt, and cook, covered, over medium heat until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain spinach and let cool, then gently squeeze out excess liquid and very finely chop.\\r\\n2. On a clean work surface, mound the flour and form a well in the center. Add the egg, olive oil, a pinch of salt and the spinach to the well. Using a fork, gently break up yolk and slowly incorporate flour from inside rim of well. Continue until liquid is absorbed.\\r\\n3. When the dough gets to stiff to work with a fork, knead the dough by hand until the dough is no longer sticky, adding additional flour in 1 tablespoon increments as necessary. Wrap dough tightly in plastic and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.\\r\\n4. Cut the dough into 2 pieces. Flatten 1 piece of dough so that it will fit through the rollers of a pasta machine. Set rollers of pasta machine at the widest setting, then feed pasta through rollers 3 or 4 times, folding and turning pasta until it is smooth and the width of the machine. Roll pasta through machine, decreasing the setting two notches at a time until pasta sheet is desired thickness. Cut sheet into rectangles the width of the pasta roller and 7 inches long. Lay the lasagna noodles on a lightly floured baking sheet in a single layer until ready to use. Do the same with the second piece of pasta dough.\\r\\nFOR BECHAMEL\\r\\n1. Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour with a wooden spoon and cook, stirring, until golden roux is achieved.\\r\\n2. Gradually whisk in the milk and bring the mixture to just under a boil. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Remove from the heat, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of the butter and stir to combine. (If not using the bÃ©chamel immediately, let it cool, cover it with plastic wrap and set aside.)\\r\\n \\r\\nFINISHING\\r\\n1. Heat the oven to 400Â°.\\r\\n2. Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil and have ready a large bowl of ice water. Add the lasagna sheets, a few at a time, to the boiling water. Cook until the noodles float to the top of the surface, about 15 seconds. Immediately remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to the ice water to keep from overcooking. Drain well and lightly pat dry with a kitchen towel. \\r\\n3. Cover a 11Â” x 7Â” by 2Â” rectangular baking dish (or similar size gratin dish) with an initial layer of lasagna, overlapping the noodles slightly and letting any excess hang over the sides. \\r\\n4. Cover with about one-fifth of each: the Bolognese sauce, the bÃ©chamel, and the cheese. Cover with another layer of pasta, trimming the noodles if necessary so they fit snug in the dish. Top with another layer of sauce, bÃ©chamel, and cheese. Repeat this step two more times for a total of four layers, saving some sauce, bÃ©chamel, and cheese for the top.\\r\\n5. To finish, fold any overflowing lasagna pasta over the dish. Top with the remaining sauce, bÃ©chamel, and cheese. \\r\\n6. Bake until the top is brown and bubbly, about 20 minutes. Let the lasagne rest for 15 to 20 minutes before slicing."},{"_id":"532bba75a4b358d8a90a88a8","title":"Lemon Confit","yield":"n/a","rating":null,"recipeId":"290","tags":" mod2","category":"","basicFlg":null,"slowFlg":null,"partyFlg":null,"appFlg":null,"entreeFlg":null,"tryFlg":null,"pastryFlg":null,"ings":[{"id":"2274","amount":"2","notes":"","value":"lemons","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2275","amount":"12 oz","notes":"","value":"superfine sugar","isHead":"0"}],"descr":"1.

Look behind the ingredients to the method, study the ones you like best in restaurants and create your own opinion of pad Thai. You can use Thai block tamarind here. It is sweeter, fruitier and less intense than the Tamicon brand rendered Indian tamarind paste. Break off a chunk of the paste. Flatten\\r\\nit and soak in the smallest amount of warm water you can, but still have it covered.\\r\\nWhen it is soft, work it a bit so that the paste withthe liquid. Push this through a fine strainer, making sure to scrape the bottom of the strainer for all the tamarind! Discard the fiber and seeds that remain in the strainer."},{"_id":"532bba75a4b358d8a90a88d4","title":"Paillasson De Pommes De Terre","yield":"1 paillasson","rating":null,"recipeId":"301","tags":"mod2","category":"vegetable","basicFlg":null,"slowFlg":null,"partyFlg":null,"appFlg":null,"entreeFlg":null,"tryFlg":null,"pastryFlg":null,"ings":[{"id":"2358","amount":"5 each","notes":"","value":"idaho potatoes","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2359","amount":"2 fl ozs","notes":"","value":"canola oil","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2360","amount":"2 oz","notes":"","value":"butter","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2361","amount":"to taste","notes":"","value":"salt","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2362","amount":"to taste","notes":"","value":"pepper","isHead":"0"}],"descr":"1.

Take the dough out and knead the dough with your hands for a good 10 minutes or so on a flat surface. The dough should be soft, moist and a little sticky, but no so sticky that it leaves clumps of dough on your hands. If you find that it's too dry, wet your fingers with water and continue to knead.

Flatten the bun with the palm of your hand and then roll it out with a rolling pin into a circle of about 10-12 inches in diameter. It will start to get messy as some of the green onions burst out from the edges of the dough. That's ok, just pick them off and continue rolling. Grease the rolling pin with oil if it sticks to the dough.\\r\\n14. Sprinkle the top with some sesame seeds and give it one last roll with the rolling pin to embed the seeds into the dough.\\r\\n15. Coat the frying pan with 2 tablespoons of oil and fry the pancakes over medium heat. Fry on both sides until they're browned. Use a little more oil for crispier pancakes.\\r\\n16.

Roll the remaining dough slightly larger than the diameter of the pan and place on top of the chard filling. Press the two pieces of dough together at the rim of the pan and remove any excess dough.\\r\\n12. Cut several slits into the top of the dough to act as steam vents. Bake in a 400Â°F oven for 30-40 minutes. The dough should be golden brown and the filling should be set.\\r\\n13. Cool on a rack. Remove the tart from the pan and serve warm or at room temperature."},{"_id":"532bba75a4b358d8a90a8989","title":"Thai Deep-fried Whole Fish With Tamarind Sauce","yield":"2 servings","rating":null,"recipeId":"593","tags":" mod3","category":"","basicFlg":null,"slowFlg":null,"partyFlg":null,"appFlg":null,"entreeFlg":null,"tryFlg":null,"pastryFlg":null,"ings":[{"id":"4830","amount":null,"notes":"","value":"fish","isHead":"1"},{"id":"4831","amount":"1 each","notes":"2 pounds","value":"whole sea bass","isHead":"0"},{"id":"4832","amount":"as needed","notes":"","value":"oil for frying","isHead":"0"},{"id":"4833","amount":null,"notes":"","value":"tamarind sauce","isHead":"1"},{"id":"4834","amount":"1 fl oz","notes":"","value":"oii from deep frying","isHead":"0"},{"id":"4835","amount":"2 tablespoons","notes":"minced","value":"garlic","isHead":"0"},{"id":"4836","amount":"2 tablespoons","notes":"minced","value":"shallot","isHead":"0"},{"id":"4837","amount":"1 tablespoons","notes":"minced","value":"ginger","isHead":"0"},{"id":"4838","amount":"1/2 to 1 tablespoons","notes":"","value":"red or green thai curry paste","isHead":"0"},{"id":"4839","amount":"8 fl ozs","notes":"","value":"water","isHead":"0"},{"id":"4840","amount":"1 tablespoon","notes":"","value":"rendered tamarind paste","isHead":"0"},{"id":"4841","amount":"2 tablespoons","notes":"","value":"palm sugar or maple syrup","isHead":"0"},{"id":"4842","amount":"1 fl oz","notes":"","value":"fish sauce","isHead":"0"},{"id":"4843","amount":"2 each","notes":"minced","value":"scallions","isHead":"0"},{"id":"4844","amount":"1/2 cup","notes":"coarsely chopped","value":"cilantro leaves","isHead":"0"},{"id":"4845","amount":"as needed","notes":"sliced","value":"cucumbers","isHead":"0"},{"id":"4846","amount":"as needed","notes":"","value":"cherry tomatoes","isHead":"0"}],"descr":"1. To prepare fish, scale it, gut it through the mouth or small rear belly cut and remove gills. Wash, dry, and salt the inside cavity of the fish. So_ore the outside of the fish with a crosshatch or crosswise at 1\\\" intervals, almost to the bone. (This will make it considerably easier to eat.) Preheat an oven to 325Â° F.\\r\\n2. Foliow the instructions for deep-frying fish in the master recipe on page 9. Dust the\\r\\nfish with cornstarch or waterchestnut flour JUST BEFORE it goes into the hot oii. If you\\r\\ndothis too soon you won't get a crispy coating. When the fish goes into the oil allow the\\r\\ntail to stick out a bit. This part cooks quicker so you can push it in laterÂ—baste the whole\\r\\nfish with oil constantly. A 2-pound fish will take about 8 to 10 minutes Â— if your fish is\\r\\nthicker it may take as long as 15 minutes. Check the doneness by pulling the fish up\\r\\nwith the large strain/scooper and poke the flesh with a chopstick to separate it to the\\r\\nbone. When the fish is done it will flake easily and the meat will look opaque white. You\\r\\nmay want to turn the fish since the side closer to the heat will cook faster.\\r\\n3. Place fish on a (pre-heated) heat-proof platter. Keep fish warm in the oven.\\r\\n4. For the sauce, heat the oil in a non-reactive saucepan or skillet. Add the garlic, shallot\\r\\nand ginger. Cook over moderate heat, taking care not to burn the garlic, until the\\r\\nvegetables are soft.\\r\\n5. Add the curry paste and cook for 2 minutes, mashing it into the oil so that\\r\\nit cooks evenly. Whisk in the water and tamarind paste and bring the mixture to a boil.\\r\\nAdd half of the sugar and fish sauce. Simmer this over moderate heat until it thickens to\\r\\na light syrup, it should coat a spoon lightly. Taste and add more of whatever you need\\r\\nto balance the flavors between salty, sweet and sour."},{"_id":"532bba75a4b358d8a90a89ab","title":"Whole Poached Fish","yield":"4 servings","rating":null,"recipeId":"257","tags":"mod2","category":"","basicFlg":null,"slowFlg":null,"partyFlg":null,"appFlg":null,"entreeFlg":null,"tryFlg":null,"pastryFlg":null,"ings":[{"id":"2044","amount":null,"notes":"","value":"white wine court bouillon","isHead":"1"},{"id":"2045","amount":"1 quart","notes":"","value":"white wine","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2046","amount":"3 lemons","notes":"","value":"lemon juice","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2047","amount":null,"notes":"","value":"sachet dÂ’epices","isHead":"1"},{"id":"2048","amount":"1.5 teaspoons","notes":"","value":"black pepercorns","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2049","amount":"2 each","notes":"","value":"bay leaves","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2050","amount":"5 sprigs","notes":"","value":"thyme","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2051","amount":"1/2 bunch","notes":"","value":"parsley","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2052","amount":"8 oz","notes":"large dice","value":"onion","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2053","amount":"4 oz","notes":"peeled, large dice","value":"carrot","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2054","amount":"4 oz","notes":"large dice","value":"celery","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2055","amount":"1/2 head","notes":"skin on","value":"garlic","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2056","amount":"2 quarts","notes":"","value":"water","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2057","amount":"4 each (24 oz)","notes":"whole, cleaned, 8 oz each","value":"brannzini fish","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2058","amount":null,"notes":"","value":"white wine sauce","isHead":"1"},{"id":"2059","amount":"8 fl oz","notes":"strained","value":"white wine court bouillon","isHead":"0"},{"id":"2060","amount":"5 oz","notes":"cold","value":"butter","isHead":"0"}],"descr":"Court Bouillon\\r\\n1.
